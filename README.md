### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dylan Sitarski!

I am interested in learning about a lot of things, including physics, math, theology, and music.

I currently study aerospace engineering, perform undergraduate research in material science, and am a student leader in the Campus Fellowship student ministry.

I like to read, run, play guitar, sketch, boulder, and do lots with friends!
